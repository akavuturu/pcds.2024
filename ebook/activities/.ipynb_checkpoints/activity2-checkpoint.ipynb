    "###  Activity 2.0: Loop Ordering and False Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity reinforces the concept of reduction and the caching principles taught in the lecture on Cilk on Sep. 18. It is recommended that you run this on the CS machines `gradx.cs.jhu.edu` or `ugradx.cs.jhu.edu`.  The results make sense here.  It is OK to run this on any machine that has at least 4 cores.  If you run on a different machine, you may end up with slightly different results. It is OK if your results don't track exactly with the expected findings. On my M1 Apple Silicon laptop the results get confusing.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a nested loop program that counts the number of occurences of a list of tokens in an array of elements. This is a common computing pattern in data analytics. This could be used to count the number of messages sent in a network from a set of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two serial versions of the program.  These are:\n",
    "  * `countTokensElementsFirst`: loop over the larger `elements` array in the outer loop and the smaller `tokens` array in the inner loop.\n",

    "1. The number of tokens is 128, while the number of elements is 4096*256. This means that accessing the `elements` array requries many cache lines, while the `tokens` array will fit into one cache line. Then, if we iterate over tokens first, we will be accessing many cache lines over and over for one iteration of the outer loop. This means we will have to load one chunk of the `elements` array into the L1 cache, read the contents, write to the `tokens` array, and then repeat until we have finished reading the entire `elements` array. In comparison, doing elements-first requires us to only load one cache line for the iteration of the outer loop. The reduction in the number of cache loads leads to an increase in performance for the elements-first approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For parallelized tokens-first and elements-first approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The tokens-first approach has unsafe sharing, because each thread will receive one iteration of the tokens array. Then, each thread will be consecutively reading and writing to the same cache line over and over, as the entire `tokens` array can fit in one cache line.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    b. The tokens-first approach assigns different elements to different threads, as the outer loop assigns each iteration to a different thread, meaning that each element of tokens (`tokens[tok]`) is accessed in a different thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the tokens-first approach, there is false sharing because the entire tokens array is cached by each thread. In effect, this means that all `n` threads are accessing the same cache line, but at different points (different indices of the `tokens_count` array). As each thread has the potential to also write to the same cache line (under the `if elements[el] == tokens[tok]` condition), this means that many threads could be overwriting the same cache line in parallel, which is false sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The unrolled loop is more efficient because we reduce the number of times we are calling the loop condition check and the loop increment. In this case, since we are unrolling the innermost loop of the elements-first implementation, this is avoiding the `tok < num_tokens` check and the `tok++` increment. We are doing these checks 8 fewer times per outer loop iteration, meaning we save $4096 * 256 * 8$ total conditional/increment instructions. These savings add up to the speedup shown in the above times (which is about 0.54 seconds)."
